Survival# is a simple bukkit/spigot plugin to tough the survival mode for personal servers.

### Why?

When I and my friends' player Minecraft, we normally play inconsequentially, letting the game a little boring. Thinking about that, I have guessed that tough it a little, it could improve our experience.

**Tested Minecraft versions:** 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16

*Actually, the plugin are under tests and changes will come in, so suggestion to improvements are so welcome.*

### Features

- Increasing the damage from all sources
- Increasing the damage taken by items 
- Decreasing the damage that mobs taken
- Decreasing the amount of XP gained
- Giving some mobs negative effects
- Deleting dropped items when player's die
